								</a></div><h2>Relax in busy Kathmandu</h2><p>I really enjoy this place. Even crazy busy kathmandu is around, when you are in the hotel its feel so relaxing. I was very glad to choose this hotel because was a relieve after be outside jusg came back and relax. The staff is helpful but need little bit more of English, still always smiling and ready to help you.&nbsp;Breakfast a la carte was nice, room service is not 24 hrs as I read somewhere, but many places around to eat, shop and drink. I recommend this place because for the price that you pay is totally worth it          </p><div><br></div><div><b>Stayed:</b> July 2017, traveled solo</div><div><br></div><div><b>Reviewed by:</b> Sthan M</div><div><br></div><div><b>Reviewed on:</b> August 6, 2017</div></div>

							<div class="news box clearfix"><h2>Being home...</h2><p>I spent almost one month at the KGH during my Laughing world tour and I 
								felt home. All the staff is warm, professional and kindhearted. 
								Everyone, from the security to the kitchen. I felt as a special guest, 
								as a family member. The food is amazing and my room was always clean. I 
								miss all of it! Very recommandable!</p><p><b>Stayed:</b> July 2017, travelled on business</p><p><b>Reviewed By:</b> David C</p><p><b>Reviewed On: </b>11 Oct 2017</p></div>
							<div class="news box clearfix"><h2>Exceptional experience</h2><p>Our team cannot say enough positive statements about this budget hotel 
								in Thamel. The rooms are clean and comfortable with plenty of hot water 
								and cool air conditioning. More importantly the staff was amazing. I 
								recently traveled with a group of teens for a week and the hotel staff 
								could not have been more accommodating. The restaurant was affordable, 
								delicious and Chef Dhakal provided us with five-star quality meals 
								custom made to our specifications. No request wast to great and he was 
								constantly offering to do more. During our visit we had two student 
								birthdays. No only did he prepare us an elegant meal, chef spent the day
								baking a most wonderful birthday cake- then the entire hotel staff 
								joined him in singing "happy birthday" to the team- you could tell that 
								they were as happy we were when presenting the cake to the birthday 
								guests. From the front desk staff to the gate security every member of 
								the team made it their personal mission to ensure our comfort and 
								safety. The hotel manager checked in with me daily to ensure our 
								satisfaction. On our day of departure my entire team felt as though we 
								were saying goodby to new friends. I would absolutely stay here again 
								and recommend this hotel to friends. The hotel is located in the heart 
								of Thamel so we could walk to many attractions including local markets, 
								shopping and an epic rock wall.</p><p><b>Stayed: </b>June 2017, traveled with friends          </p></div>
							<div class="news box clearfix"><h2>Great hotel</h2><p>I have stayed in this hotel for few nights in June. This is a great 
								hotel for a great price. The hotel has everything that is needed for 
								comfortable stay, good restaurant with options of food. Friendly staff 
								and a beautiful garden which is very hard to find in Thamel hotels so 
								this is big plus. I have been to Kathmandu before and this hotel became 
								my favourite place to stay. This feels truly like home. The rooms are 
								great with a balcony to sit and relax. Highly recommended. Walking 
								distance to everything.</p><p><b>Stayed: </b>June 2017, traveled with friends          </p></div>
							<div class="news box clearfix"><h2>The best budget hotel in Thamel !!</h2><p>We stayed for 7 nights here and enjoyed every single moment. It's a very
								new hotel with friendly and helpful staff. There is lovely inner court 
								with nice garden. We get nice welcome from the staff with drinks. The 
								reception and restaurant staff are very nice and always helpful. Highly 
								recommend !!</p><p><b>Stayed:</b> May 2017, traveled with family          </p></div>
							<div class="news box clearfix"><h2>Good Budget Hotel</h2><p>Small Lobby, Small Restaurant, Spacious Rooms, Spacious Bathrooms, 
								Satisfactory Breakfast. Nice Front Lawn. Good Location, at the heart of 
								Thamel. One bad thing is that they close their restaurant very early and
								we had to buy our dinner from outside. However, the staffs are very 
								cooperative and also the Managing Director of the hotel, who was very 
								friendly and cooperative.</p><p><b>Stayed:</b> May 2017, traveled as a couple          </p></div>
							<div class="news box clearfix"><h2>Nice, relatively quiet oasis in the middle of Thamel</h2><p>The staff is very friendly, you get a welcome tee or coffee when you 
								arrive, and the restaurant is open around the clock. The hotel is 
								located in the middle of Thamel, so you just walk straight out of the 
								gates and into the vibrant life of Kathmandu.</p><p>The hotel garden is 
								very charming and the restaurant serves decent food, so you can easily 
								spend half a day relaxing at the hotel.</p><p><b>Stayed:</b> May 2017, traveled with friends          </p></div>
							<div class="news box clearfix"><h2>Great location</h2><p>The hotel is situated to the north of Thamel but is within easy walking 
								distance of the many shops, bars and restaurants of Thamel. I arrived a 
								little after 9am and was welcomed with tea and water and after checking 
								in was given the room key to my room way earlier than I expected. The 
								rooms are large and there is a great amount of hot water! Breakfast is 
								good and there is plenty of choice. Give this place a go you won't be 
								disappointed! </p><p><b>Stayed: </b>April 2017, traveled solo</p></div>
							<div class="news box clearfix"><h2>Fantastic time</h2><p>Really happy about this hotel. Room clean, bed really comfortable, 
								modern furniture, working AC and hot shower. Staff really friendly and 
								helpful. Lovely inner court with refreshing garden. We were able to 
								store our luggage while traveling in Nepal. I strongly recommend 
								Kathmandu Garden home.          </p></div>

							<div class="news box clearfix"><h2>Stop looking - Kathmandu Garden Home is an easy choice!</h2><p>Very nice, new hotel, comfortable beds and friendly staff â€“ easily 
								recommended!
								We stayed in several different hotels before we found this one and none 
								were even close to as good as this one! The location 100 meters outside 
								of Thamel was also great!          </p></div>
